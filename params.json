{"name":"Tik-git","tagline":"TIK-Kolloquium/GitHub Einführung","body":"### Welcome to the example TIK/GitHub Page.\r\nThis page has been generated with GitHub Page generator. The content can be formatted using GitHub Flavored Markdown. To check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd src/tik-git\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nThere are already some handsome templates for you to use. Blah, blah, blah\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nThe git pages could also be created manually: push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and they’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
